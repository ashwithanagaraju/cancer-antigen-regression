# Cancer Antigen Regression

This project implements a regression-based modeling approach to predict cancer antigen levels from clinical features. The solution focuses on applying linear and regularized regression techniques to model relationships between clinical measurements and antigen concentration, supporting quantitative analysis and interpretation in a healthcare analytics context.

The project evaluates multiple regression formulations to balance predictive accuracy and model interpretability. Model performance is assessed using standard regression metrics, and coefficient analysis is used to examine feature influence, demonstrating how regression models can be applied to clinical data for outcome estimation and analytical insight in applied medical and biomedical research scenarios.
